# Simple blog, powered by RoR 3.0.9 (will work with 3.1)
writed for education only...

1. Test coverage? It's matter
2. Auth via social networks
3. Ajax, if we need it
4. Parts of html/css coding (still hate it, yeah)

install:

* git clone git@github.com:ecuezzo/RoR-blog.git
* cd RoR-blog
* bundle install
* rake db:migrate
* rake db:seed
* rails s (or what you like, may be passenger)

admin login/pass are stored in db/seeds.rb, so don't forget to change it, before run
rake db:seed
